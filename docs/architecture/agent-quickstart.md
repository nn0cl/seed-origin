# Agent Quickstart

Use this as the first short entry point before coding.

## Session Entry

Each new LLM session starts without prior chat context.

1. Read the Adjudicator message for operating path, phase, spec or ADR, issue,
   and branch.
2. If resuming, read the cited handoff or trace before other documents.
3. Recover progress from repository artifacts, not from assumed chat history.
4. If path, phase, or authoritative scope is missing, stop after design intake
   and ask the Adjudicator.

For Adjudicator checklists and resume examples, see
`docs/collaboration/session-start-and-resume.md`.

## Operating Paths

Select the smallest path that safely fits the request.

### Fast Path

Use for mechanical, local, and low-risk work such as formatting, typo fixes,
file moves, script syntax checks, README clarifications, or deterministic
verification.

Read:

1. this file.
2. directly touched files.
3. `docs/collaboration/definition-of-done.md` before final reporting.

Output a compact design note with scope, omitted context, deterministic checks,
and why Feature Path or Architecture Path is unnecessary.

Do not use Fast Path when the task changes behavior, tests, architecture,
agent instructions, collaboration rules, privacy policy, or accepted specs.

### Feature Path

Use for Phase 1, 2, or 3 feature work.

Read:

1. this file.
2. `docs/at-tdd/process.md`.
3. `docs/collaboration/ai-human-scheme.md`.
4. `docs/architecture/ai-request-routing.md`.
5. target specification under `docs/specs/`.
6. area-specific architecture document.
7. `docs/architecture/implementation-readiness.md`.
8. `docs/architecture/io-reasoning-contracts.md` only when AI/model output is
   involved.

Output the full `[THOUGHT]` scaffold and execute only the requested phase.

### Architecture Path

Use for ADRs, dependency boundaries, privacy-sensitive routing, prompt or
instruction changes, process changes, and conflicts between rules.

Read:

1. this file.
2. `docs/collaboration/ai-human-scheme.md`.
3. `docs/architecture/ai-request-routing.md`.
4. `docs/collaboration/model-tool-capability-matrix.md`.
5. `docs/collaboration/privacy-context-budget-policy.md`.
6. relevant ADRs and touched contract files.
7. `docs/architecture/io-reasoning-contracts.md` when AI/model output is
   involved.

Output the full `[THOUGHT]` scaffold and stop for Adjudicator approval when a new
architecture or process decision is required.

## Design First

Every user request starts with a design note before tests or implementation.
Size the note to the selected operating path.

The design note selects:

- target behavior.
- next AT-TDD phase.
- context to include in AI requests.
- context to omit from AI requests.
- lightweight VO or DTO candidates.
- ports and adapters involved.
- task routing to model, assistant, or deterministic tool.
- input, output, and reasoning evidence contracts when AI or model output is
  involved.

Fast Path may omit non-applicable VO/DTO, ports/adapters, and AI output
contract fields when it explicitly states that they are not involved.

## Phase Rule

Only execute the phase explicitly requested by the Adjudicator.

- Phase 1: failing tests only.
- Phase 2: minimum implementation only.
- Phase 3: refactor and reviewer empathy summary.

Phase transitions require Adjudicator approval. Do not start Phase 2 from
unreviewed Phase 1 tests.

## Bug Triage

Bug fixes follow the same phase rule as feature work. A minor bug may omit a
separate local issue or work plan only when it is size `S`, within already
approved scope, clear from existing behavior or specification, low risk, and
verified in the same attempt.

Omitting a separate planning artifact does not permit skipping Phase 1, Phase
2, Phase 3, deterministic verification, or Adjudicator review gates.

When a bug is size `M` or larger, needs a second execution attempt, changes
boundaries, or remains ambiguous, record it in a local issue or active work
plan before continuing.

## Core Boundaries

- Domain has no UI framework, DB, file-system, network, or third-party
  provider dependency.
- Use cases depend on domain and ports.
- Adapters implement ports.
- Delivery handlers (UI components, HTTP/RPC handlers, CLI entry points) are
  thin and call use cases only.
- `<Add your project's primary datastore and any settings-gated secondary
  store rules here, e.g. "Postgres is the primary application database" or
  "Analytics writes are gated by a feature flag".>`

## Required Area Documents

- Test placement: `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`
- File placement: `docs/architecture/project-structure.md`
- Dependency policy: `docs/architecture/dependency-policy.md`
- AI input/output/reasoning: `docs/architecture/io-reasoning-contracts.md`
- AI-human collaboration: `docs/collaboration/ai-human-scheme.md`
- `<Add one line per stack-specific architecture document you create, e.g.
  "Backend core: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md.">`

## Stop Conditions

Stop and ask for Adjudicator decision or ADR when the task requires choosing:

- `<Persistence engine or schema details beyond the accepted baseline>`.
- `<Vector DB / embedding model or dimensions>`.
- `<External vault/layout convention>`.
- `<Provider API or SDK>`.
- `<Any other technology choice listed as a "Current Non-Decision" in
  CLAUDE.md>`.
